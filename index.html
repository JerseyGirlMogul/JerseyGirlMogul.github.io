  <h1>Lisboa is Calling</h1>
    <img src="JerseyGirlMogul.github.io/images/firefox2.png" alt="My test image">
  <p>Lisbon, Portugal or as residents call it, Lisboa, is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. Cobblestone streets leading to the Targus River. Belem Tower. Buildings covered in tile of all different designs and hues.  One can see the influence of Moorish rule in the architecture.  From the moment I stepped foot in the <a href="https://www.discoverwalks.com/blog/what-to-do-in-lisbon-around-chiado/">Chiado</a> neighborhood, I knew I would make this city my home.</p>
   
<p> Now to begin the daunting process of acquiring residency.  A flood of questions raced through my mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What documentation would I need?</li>  
  <li>Will I buy or rent?</li>  
  <li>What neighborhoods have the amenities and historic feel that I crave?</li>  
  <li>What amount of money should I have saved before making such a move?</li>
